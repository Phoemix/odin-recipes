<p>the cotoletta alla milanese is a classic of Milan's cuisine, up there with saffron-stained risotto, osso buco and panettone. It gets its name from the cut of meat traditionally used, la costoletta, an inch-thick bone-in veal chop, which would correspond to a prime rib cut, such as rib eye. A second version of the cotoletta is made with a beaten-out-till-enormous-but-thin cutlet of veal, aptly called l'orecchia di elefante (elephant's ear), as reference to its size and shape. It's for those who like their fried goods crunchy all the way.</p>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Ingredients</h3> 
<ul>
    <li><strong>4</strong> veal chops, such as bone-in rib eye</li>
    <li><strong>2</strong> eggs</li>
    <li><strong>1 cup</strong>  (125 grams) breadcrumbs</li>
    <li><strong>3/4 cup</strong>(6 ounces or 170 grams) clarified butter</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Preperation</h3> 
<ol>
    <li>Pat the veal chops well with kitchen paper so they are as dry as possible. In a shallow bowl, crack the eggs and beat. In another bowl, place the breadcrumbs.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Dip the chops in the beaten egg, letting any excess egg drip off before placing in the breadcrumbs to coat entirely. Pat down the breadcrumbs well. Rest in fridge for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Place the clarified butter (see <a href="http://food52.com/blog/5871-how-to-make-clarified-butter-and-ghee">this</a> article for how to easily make this) in a skillet over medium heat. Fry the chops until golden brown. Turn the chops once and continue frying until cooked through, about 6-8 minutes per side. You may need to cook just two chops at a time; if doing this, use half the butter for each pair of chops.</li>
    <li>Remove from the pan and place on a wire rack to rest the meat. You may want to place it somewhere to keep warm, such as in a low oven (or an oven that was heated and then turned off), but do not cover it or place it directly on a plate as it will become soggy. Season with salt and serve warm with a wedge of lemon if desired.</li>
